# Protocols

For all interfaces that use a standard industry protocol or an internal/proprietary protocol, list them here and link to the relevant specifications that govern those protocols. If any interfaces use custom protocols that are not defined elsewhere, define them in detail here, with one subsection per protocol. Make sure to define any protocols that involve more than one interface [[1]](references.md#ref1). For custom protocols, feel free to add as much information as needed so they can be easily understood, used, and tested.

## Standard Protocols

### Protocol 1

- **Description**: Brief description of the protocol.
- **Specification**: [Link to the protocol specification](http://example.com/specification1).

### Protocol 2

- **Description**: Brief description of the protocol.
- **Specification**: [Link to the protocol specification](http://example.com/specification2).

## Custom Protocols

### Custom Protocol 1

- **Description**: Detailed description of the custom protocol.
- **Involved Interfaces**: List of interfaces that use this protocol.
- **Data Format**: Definition of the data format exchanged.
- **Communication Sequence**: Details about the communication sequence between interfaces.

### Custom Protocol 2

- **Description**: Detailed description of the custom protocol.
- **Involved Interfaces**: List of interfaces that use this protocol.
- **Data Format**: Definition of the data format exchanged.
- **Communication Sequence**: Details about the communication sequence between interfaces.
