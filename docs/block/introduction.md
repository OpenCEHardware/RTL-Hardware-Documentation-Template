# Introduction

This section provides a description of the block. It briefly covers, at a high level, what the block does and presents a "bird's-eye" black-box view of the top-level module. It discusses the goals and non-goals of the block, how it is intended to integrate into a larger system, lists standard protocols, highlights important performance requirements, and touches on debugging features. It outlines the design methodology (coding language, internal and third-party libraries and IPs), and anything else a verification engineer should know before writing the first draft of the test plan [[1]](references.md#ref1). Most of these concepts can be expressed as a list of features, as seen in an IÂ²C-Master Core Specification [[2]](references.md#ref2) example.
